      <description>Introduction Project-X (unofficial name) is an upcoming role-playing game (RPG). It&amp;rsquo;s an open world RPG with turn-based battle system. The game is fully developed on Unreal Engine 4.
Every month, there will be new content added to this website (videos, pictures or information) so people that want to know about this project will be informed with details and be able to express their opinion.
The plan is to release a small part of the first chapter (after that part will be at least 90% completed obviously) to the public.</description>
